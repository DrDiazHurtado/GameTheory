# GameTheory
Theory of the Prisoner's Dilemma:
The Prisoner's Dilemma is a fundamental example in game theory showcasing how rational individuals might not cooperate, even when it's in their best interest. It involves two prisoners, each facing the choice to betray the other or remain silent. The dilemma arises because the optimal decision for each depends on what the other chooses. If both betray, they get moderate sentences; if one betrays and the other remains silent, the betrayer goes free while the other faces a harsh sentence. Mutual silence leads to minimal sentences. The Prisoner's Dilemma illustrates the conflict between individual and collective rationality.

About the Code:
The provided Python code simulates various strategies from game theory, such as Tit-for-Tat, Always Defect, and Always Cooperate, in a scenario resembling the Prisoner's Dilemma. These strategies are played against each other over multiple rounds, and their outcomes are scored based on cooperation and betrayal. The code then ranks these strategies by their average scores, visualizing the effectiveness of each in a bar graph. This simulation helps understand which strategies might be most effective in repeated game scenarios like the Prisoner's Dilemma.
